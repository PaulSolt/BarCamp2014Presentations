**$47,000 on Kickstarter: Start a successful project**

I wanted to share my experiences raising money on Kickstarter. You need to plan before, during, and after. You must value your work at a resonable price, and remember that people on Kickstarter are willing to donate serious cash! If you only target low reward levels, you'll only raise small amounts of money.

**iPhone 101**

I wanted to show a compelling use for Gestures with a simple app that can convert between two quanitities. I plan on making a unit converting app, and this is the beginning of that endeavour.

Drag up and down on the numbers to change quanities, and overlay a special UIView on top to display data above the finger. When you interact with a touch-based app, you need to show data that sits behind the finger.
